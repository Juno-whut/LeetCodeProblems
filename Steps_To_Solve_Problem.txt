1: Understand Problem and All Examples

2: Brainstorm Approaches

3: Think of space/runtime until satisfied

4: Think of implementation of Approach

5: Think of base cases or extreme Examples

6: Add in UnitTests for step 5

7: Code

8: If it doesnt work, debug by gathering more info (stepping through in debugger or paper)

9: Double check space/runtime complexity still matches step 3
